# Sudoku Solver

One of the algorithms used to solve sudoku puzzles operates via the concept of recursive-backtracking. When teaching this programming concept, its application in solving sudokus is often used. 

This is a C++ console application which implements a recursive-backtracking algorithm that can solve any valid sudoku puzzle.


# Language

This program uses the ISO C++14 Standard.
